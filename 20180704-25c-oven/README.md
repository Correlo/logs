## run 1

uninsulated oven prototype, no compensation.

soldered a 20k in parallel with the 10k below the thermistor, to ajust the set-point to a higher temperature.

measuring the difference between the inverting and non-inverting op amp inputs, using a Keithley 2015.

## run 2

removing 20k parallel resistor.

measuring the difference between the inverting and non-inverting op amp inputs, using a Keithley 2015.
