Attempting to measure the tempco of my HP 34401A.

I have an LM399 board (sitting at room temp) connected to the HP, which started at room temp and was then put into my refrigerator, then removed again.

An Si7021 was used to log temperature, and stayed with the HP 34401A.  Room temperature was assumed to stay relatively constant.
