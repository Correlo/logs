## run 1

This was a run with the AE XT 10K000 which I had previously measured, just to see if this would work at all.

While setting this up I accidentally drove the temperature of the chamber up very high (12V, 3A into the peltier, with the hot side going into the chamber, for about 10 minutes).  When I noticed it was drawing current, I shut off the power supply.  A few minutes later I checked the log output and it was coming down, currently at 50C.  I had to prey the lid off because the hot glue had re-melted and adhered to the lid.  Oops.

Anyway, it looks like this first graph is garbage.  Probably a lot of hysteresis.
