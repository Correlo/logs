Some 1/f noise (0.1Hz to 10Hz) measurements of my EDC MV 106 using pipelie's LNA.

This LNA has a gain of 10,000, so I've configured my scope for a 100x probe,
which makes the units easier to deal with:
- 1V on the scope equals 1uV measured
- 100mV on scope equals 100nV measured

MV 106 set to 7V output.

Results:
