just a quick spot-check of LTZ1000 #4 while stepping out to grab some groceries.

LTZ1000 #4 is on the CSI1802X supply at 15V.

Edit: wow, while watching the log via ssh, just getting up and walking out of
the room shifted the output from ~540 to ~523 uV (near the beginning of the log).
I started the log while sitting in a chair just in front of the LTZ, ssh'ed in
from my laptop, then got up and walked out of the room.
