This was a test run with a brand new LT6657-1.25V in my 25C isothermal chamber.

I plan on using this in a precision current source to measure the temperature coefficient of precision resistors, and I wanted to get a baseline of how stable this reference is.

Considering LT publishes this reference as having a tempco of 1.5ppm/C, and considering my 25C isothermal box can maintain +/-0.01C, I'd say the drift isn't due to the reference itself (perhaps my cables or my HP 34401A itself).
