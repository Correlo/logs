## run 1

first run.  the output behavior looks strange.  I don't think this can be explained by "bad PID constants".

- 34401A (thermistor, 2-wire mode, 6-digit slow) is on /dev/ttyUBS0.
- Si7021 (isothermal) is on /dev/ttyACM0
- Si7021 (ambient) is on /dev/ttyACM1

## run 2

hooked up the serial output of the controller.

- Si7021 (isothermal) is on /dev/ttyACM0
- Si7021 (ambient) is on /dev/ttyACM1
