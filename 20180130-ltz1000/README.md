## run 1:

ltz #4 to #3, back to back.

powered by linear supplies at 15V (CSI1802X and DIY LM317).

V- supply connections are jumpered with thick wire.

short cat5 pair to 34401A using q-tips.

paper towel covers connections.

meter and ltz cases are sitting on a sheet of foil which is clipped to the chassis ground of the 34401A.

## run 2:

same setup, but I removed the cotton balls from above the ltz's.


## run 3:

just measuring ltz #4 now.

## run 4:

switching the power supply to a lipo running through a 7815.  still measuring ltz #4.

during this run, I noticed that if I picked the 1590BB case up off of the aluminum foil and held it in my hand, it induced nearly 1mV offset.  whoa!

## run 5:

same as run 4, but without touching it.  (run 4 was remarkably stable before I started picking up the case).
